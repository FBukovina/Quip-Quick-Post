# opensocial

opensocial is a new social media network to feel like Twitter, but...
We offer Apple Design standard, so it looks like It's from Apple. Twitter have only like button(with heart icon), we have like(thumbUp) and dislike(thumbDown), which will change soon to love(heart icon).

At this time, we're having problems with XCFramework, so no screenshots now, but we're trying to fix this last issue as soon as possible.
